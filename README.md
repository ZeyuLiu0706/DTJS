Adaptive Data and Task Joint Scheduling for Multi-Task Learning 
	
IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) 2025

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
- We propose DTJS, a novel adaptive Data and Task Joint Scheduling approach based on bi-level optimization for MTL, which mitigates performance degradation from the perspective of data and task co-scheduling.
- We propose intra-task scheduling that considers task-specific data difficulty to mitigate the negative influence of challenging data within each task, as well as inter-task scheduling that self-adaptively perceives the varying effects of task conflicts on different tasks and adjusts the training process to enhance joint training.

  <p><i>The overall framework of DTJS. DTJS consists of intra-task scheduling, inter-task scheduling, and bi-level optimization. The MTL model parameter is updated during the lower-level optimization, and the learnable task conflict perception is optimized via upper-level optimization.</i></p>
